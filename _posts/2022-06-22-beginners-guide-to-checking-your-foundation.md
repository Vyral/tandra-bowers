Do you have cracks in your home’s foundation? Maybe you’ve been worried about some damage for a while but aren’t sure how serious the problem is. Today I’m speaking with Ken Justice from KMJ Inc. to help you answer these questions.&nbsp;

According to Ken, there are two main things you should look for in your foundation. First, **is it made out of wood blocks or concrete?** You will get different types of cracks depending on the answer.

Second**, is the crack a hairline fracture or something deeper?** A hairline crack usually means the house is settled, and they’re very common in our area. If you find this type of crack, you have nothing to worry about. The only exception is if you find out these cracks are caused by loose water, but we’ll cover that in another blog post.

Ken also mentioned to watch out for more serious cracks or damages to the wood beams that hold up your house. If the beams are twisted or disconnected, your home could be in danger, and you need to act immediately.&nbsp;

If you have questions about foundations or would like to contact Ken, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!&nbsp;
