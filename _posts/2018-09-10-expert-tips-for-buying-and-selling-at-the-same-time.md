Real estate transactions can be a stressful undertaking, and this is especially true for those who have to take on two at once. With this in mind, is it better to buy before you sell, or sell before you buy?

First, deciding to sell before you buy eliminates the pressure of acting as a contingent buyer.

As a reminder, contingent buyers are those who need to sell their current property before buying their next one, while non-contingent buyers are able to close at any time without such a stipulation.

**With as common as multiple offer situations still are in our market, being a non-contingent buyer may be easier**. Selling first allows you to be more creative in your home search and, eventually, your home purchase.

On the other hand, if buying before you sell is a feasible option for you, there can be certain benefits to this strategy as well.

**The best way for you to make the best decision for your circumstances is to talk to a strong, local lender well in advanc****e**. They will be able to help you determine how to navigate through tackling two transactions at once.
