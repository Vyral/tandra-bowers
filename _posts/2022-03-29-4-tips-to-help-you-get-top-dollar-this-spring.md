Are you thinking about selling your home in 2022? The housing market has certainly been favorable for sellers, but that doesn’t mean you can throw a for-sale sign in your yard and expect to get top dollar. That’s why today I want to share four things you can do to get the most money possible for your home.&nbsp;

1. **Don’t wait for mortgage rates to get too high.** Although current rates are still low from a historical perspective, they are increasing. As interest rates climb higher, buyers’ purchasing power will decrease. This means fewer people may be willing to offer you top dollar, so list your home before mortgage rates increase further.&nbsp;
2. **Keep tabs on the competition.** The more houses you see listed in the local market, the more options buyers have. If you keep track of other homes and notice more people are listing, it’s a sign that you should make a move sooner rather than later. You want as many buyers making offers on your property as possible. If they have other options, you may have to settle for a less-than-perfect deal.&nbsp;
3. **Invest in repairs instead of upgrades.** You may be tempted to update your kitchen or bathroom, but that isn’t necessary in this market. Instead, focus on things like leaky roofs or chipped paint. You want your potential buyers to feel comfortable making you an offer, and if they notice issues with your home, they may look elsewhere. If you think your house is outdated, keep an eye on my blog. I’ll have more to say on that topic later.&nbsp;
4. **Partner with a local real estate agent.** Since buyers might be clambering for homes, you may feel compelled to try and sell your house yourself, but I can’t recommend it. A good agent can give you tips and tricks to help you reach a price point you may not have thought possible. Plus, multiple-offer situations are likely in this market. Your agent can help you choose the best offer to fit your needs.&nbsp;
