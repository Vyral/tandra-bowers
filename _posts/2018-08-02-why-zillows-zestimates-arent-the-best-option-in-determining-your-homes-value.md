Whether you’re a buyer or a seller, you probably shouldn’t trust a Zillow Zestimate to give an accurate home valuation.

If you’re a seller, using Zillow is a good way to market your home and get it sold, but their **Zestimate feature doesn’t include all the factors that go into accurately determining its value**.

There are three factors, in particular, that primarily determine a home’s value. The first is the average price of other homes that have sold in your current area in the last 180 days or less. The second is the condition of your property, and this is where Zillow becomes less reliable. There’s no way a Zestimate can determine the condition of your home—someone has to physically take a look at it to do that.

The third factor is its location. Does it sit next to a busy road or is it located at the end of a cul-de-sac?

To get a truly accurate home valuation, **you should contact an experienced real estate agent or an appraiser.**
