Today I wanted to talk about some hidden costs of homeownership that you really should know about:

**1\. Closing costs.** These are all of the transactional costs that go into buying a home past the actual mortgage payment. Transfer tax, property tax escrows, lender fees, appraisal fees, and title insurance are a few of the costs you’ll run into.

**2\. Furniture.** You’ll have to furnish the new house, so make sure you have money set aside for that.

**3\. Ongoing maintenance.** You’ve had an inspection, so you should have a good idea of what you may need to fix, but there will always be things that come up. You need to have an emergency fund for these unexpected repairs.

**4\. Tax and insurance.** We already covered some of these in the closing costs, but be aware that there will be ongoing fees around both your taxes and insurance.

**5\. Property utilities.** If you can, get a good estimate of the monthly utility bills from the previous owner. This includes things like the sewer bill, the electric bill, and the water bill.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about these costs, feel free to call me at 215-680-4652. I’d love to hear from you.
