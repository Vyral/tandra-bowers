We’re giving back to a local family in need, and we need your help.

To us, the holiday season is about giving back to those in need, and we need your help to do it. We’re incredibly fortunate to have wonderful friends, family, and clients. To express our gratitude, we want to give back to a local family who’s experiencing hardship this year.&nbsp;

**If you know a family in need, please reach out to me about them.** We want to choose a family by December 21, so please don’t delay. This holiday season is all about community and supporting each other. Remember: Kindness is free, so take the time to show it to someone you don’t know yet. Together, we’re stronger.

We wish you a very joyful, safe, and healthy holiday season. I, my husband Jeremy, and my daughter Alexa look forward to assisting a family in need.&nbsp;

If you want to tell us about a family in need or have any questions, call or email me. I would love to speak with you.
