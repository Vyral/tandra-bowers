It's no secret that the market is changing. There's been a lot of noise surrounding this topic, but which pieces of information are true, and which ones aren't? To help clear up some of the confusion, we'd like to address two myths surrounding today's market:

**Myth No. 1: It's no longer a good time to buy a home due to rising rates.&nbsp;**

Fact: Don't get too caught up on the rate. You can take advantage of great opportunities such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM), portfolio deals, etc. if you want to buy a home in today's market.

**Myth No. 2: If you sell your home on the market now, you'll have difficulty finding your next property.**

Fact: We can provide solutions for you. We don't have a crystal ball, but we plan, strategize, and discuss your options. Nine times out of 10, we can find our sellers their next property before they put their home on the market.

It's still a great time to buy or sell in this shifting market. If you need more details about this topic or have any real estate concerns, don't hesitate to call or email me. I'll be happy to help\!
