Recently, our team has talked to a lot of people who want to sell their homes, but they are concerned about what they’re going to do once their properties are sold. We understand; it’s a lot easier to sell than buy in today’s market. We’ve helped plenty of people in every situation imaginable, so today we want to go over your options when it comes to buying and selling at the same time.&nbsp;

Your first option is to **list your home for sale only after you’ve gone under contract with your new home.** In this scenario, both transactions would close on the same day. In the morning, you would sell your old house, and in the afternoon, you’d close on your new home. We’d pack up all your belongings before, so you can get started moving in immediately. This option can be tough to negotiate, but our team has plenty of experience doing it successfully.&nbsp;

Your next option is to **sell your old home, get your money, and move into temporary housing** while you look for a new home. This gives you plenty of time to look for your dream home, and many people prefer to search for homes this way.&nbsp;

Finally, you can **negotiate a post-settlement possession** upfront when you sell your home. This means you would rent your old house from the people you just sold it to while you search for a new home. This option is very convenient, and it’s popular in our hot seller’s market.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about any of these options, please call or email us. We are always willing to help\!
