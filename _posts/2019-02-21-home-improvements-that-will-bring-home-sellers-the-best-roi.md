If you’re a home seller, what can do to your home to get the best return on investment?

**According to Laurie Allison, a state-certified residential appraiser with 29 years of experience in the real estate industry, here are the top tasks you can focus on:**

* Decluttering
* Upgrading your flooring
* Updating your kitchen and bathrooms
* Adding a fresh coat of paint&nbsp;

This is important to know in terms of getting the value you want for your home. Most buyers need a mortgage loan when purchasing a house, and an appraiser’s job is to determine whether a home is worth the price the buyer is willing to pay for it.
