  Now that we’re progressing into 2019, sellers are thinking about when to list
  their homes on the market. If you’re one of them, selling now may give you an
  upper hand over the competition and save you from just being a number in the
  spring market frenzy.

Inspired by these cold winter days, I’d like to share some tips for selling your home in the winter months and the reasons for doing so.

1. **Buyers are motivated**. It doesn’t take much thought to realize that a buyer who can withstand the cold and be on the market this time of year, umbrella in hand, is likely determined to buy soon.
2. **There is less competition.** By listing now, you’ll be a few steps ahead of the spring market and the torrent of competition that will follow.
3. **Make sure your home is priced correctly.** If you do choose to sell during the winter, be careful not to overprice your home or test the market. Evaluate sale prices of comparable homes over the last 60 days and decide what price point you can be successful in.

Test and ensure that your roof, furnace, and HVAC are working.
