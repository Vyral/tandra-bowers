Will these rates ever come back down? Nobody has a crystal ball, but we can give you some tips from having done this for over 20 years. The bottom line is that you want to buy the house and **focus on the monthly payment, not the interest rate.**

Most people are refinancing within five years of owning their home. The point is that it’s not always about the rate. We can’t predict whether these rates will come down, and historically they’re actually around their average right now. In fact, we bought our house at this rate for $225,000. **It’s worth over $600,000 right now.** The point is, what is the value of the home going to be after five, ten, or 15 years?

So if you are thinking about buying and getting concerned about all the news regarding the interest rate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We can help you find the right answers for your situation.
