I’m excited to introduce you today to Carl Scaramuzza, CEO of Credit Blueprint, who told me some really interesting information that I think you need to know. Most buyers are afraid to have their credit pulled out of fear of lowering their score. That’s why Carl recommends that you do all of your mortgage lending research done in a 30-day window. You can have your credit pulled as many times as you like and it only counts as one inquiry.&nbsp;
