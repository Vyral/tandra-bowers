Today, we’re here to share a great tip on how to brighten your house: paint. One of the most popular paint colors right now is Snowball White by Sherwin-Williams. It is continually gaining popularity, and we have even used it in our own house to replace the brown in our living room.&nbsp;

In the video above, you can see pictures that show the difference between how dark the room looked when it was painted brown and how much brighter it looks now that it’s white. **The room feels completely different, and we can help you accomplish that in your house.**

Note that the white is a little different than the white on your trim, and that’s okay. Also, don’t worry about the walls getting marked up—the type of paint we recommend has a bit of a sheen, so you can wipe down the walls and not worry about nicks from kids or pets.&nbsp;

**We have renovated over 100 houses, so know we can help you with this.** Our ability to do this sets us apart from most Realtors. We understand the process and can help you every step of the way, so call or email us anytime if you want help. We look forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;
