Today I’m delighted to be joined by Marykay Lojewski, a professional stager on our team, and we’re very excited to talk to you about the importance of staging your home and getting it ready for the market when it comes time to sell.

We wanted to give you some tips and pointers and let you know about where we focused our efforts in a recent home staging. **Here’s an outline of our discussion, with timestamps so you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:**

0:30- “Before” footage of a cluttered and messy basement that we staged

2:45- “After” footage of the fully staged basement

5:25- Moving on to the kitchen space and what we did there

6:45- Post-staging footage of the kitchen

8:30- “Before” footage of the master bedroom

9:22- “After” footage of the staged master bedroom

**As you can see in the video above, home staging is an art and a science, and it really makes a huge difference when selling your home.**

 If you have any questions for us in the meantime about home staging or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
