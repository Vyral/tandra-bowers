How do you buy an investment property? We’ve been buying investment properties since 2003, and have become experts in the process. Essentially, there are three steps you have to take. First, you have to figure out the capital. Next, you have to know where to find them. Lastly, you need to determine your return. We’ll elaborate more on that:

1. **How can you pay for the costs?** Maybe you have a rich relative, know of a small bank, or have the money saved for buying. The first two may come with different rates and paperwork. If you need help with this, reach out to us so we can guide you and connect you with the right contacts.
2. **Where do you find investment properties?** That's where we come into play. Most of the homes you find on the MLS are overpriced or it's just hard to make the numbers work. We buy houses on the MLS and privately. We can find you a house in Cape May that will fit your budget, and if you're looking for a beach property, we can help.<br>
3. **What are your returns?** To determine your returns, you have to know your appreciation, depreciation, cash flow, and forced pay-down debt. There are different amortization calculators that we use online to help us calculate these numbers, and we can do the same for you.

We understand what it takes and how to help you successfully buy your investment property. Also, if you want to just renovate your house, we can help with that too. If you’re interested in learning more about how you can build wealth through investment properties, call or email us. We’d love to be your real estate resource.
