Do you know anybody who’s looking to relocate to another state? I’ve helped many people relocate both to and from Pennsylvania. People relocate for different reasons, including family, culture, climate, affordability, and many more, and if you have a specific timeline in mind, the process can get even trickier.&nbsp; Here are four tips to help you move to a new state smoothly:

1. **Plan your budget.** Did you consider moving and travel costs? Have you budgeted for your down payment and closing costs, and how do you plan to furnish that new home? Before you start house hunting, make a list of your must-haves for your new house and the area it’s in.<br>&nbsp;
2. **Reach out to a trusted Realtor early.** Get a feel for the market you’re moving to as soon as possible because it might be very different than the market you’re coming from. Some transactions might take months, and others might take weeks, so get in contact with a trusted agent right away.<br>&nbsp;
3. **Talk to a lender.** A Realtor can connect you with great local mortgage experts who understand the market. They’ll walk you through the closing process and help you find homes. They’ll help you refine your budget and get you pre-approved before you start looking at homes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
4. **Set up showings.** If you’re not in the area yet, you can do live virtual showings, and if you plan to visit, you can create a showing schedule and visit the homes in person. When you’re in town, you’ll want to visit local restaurants, grocery stores, libraries, schools, and whatever else is important to you. Make sure the area fits your lifestyle.

If you have any questions or know someone who’s looking to relocate, call me at (215) 680-4652. I look forward to hearing from you.
