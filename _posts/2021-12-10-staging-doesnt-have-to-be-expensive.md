We’ve all seen those shows with all the amazing houses. They’re a perfect example of why staging is so important. Whether we’re in a seller’s market or not, we want to make sure your home looks its best. It doesn’t take a lot of money to do it, and you get a fantastic return on your investment.&nbsp;

Let’s say you have some outdated features, but **you want to enhance the look of the house without renovating.** For example, if you had some Formica countertops, we’d want to add some color and make that kitchen feel inviting.

**Or maybe you have an old, ratty comforter that is just so comfortable.** We can keep that comforter for you to sleep with but buy a new comforter from HomeGoods and have that on the bed while we’re taking pictures or showing buyers around. Staging doesn’t have to be that pricey.

You can take a look at my photos and see how some of those properties were staged. If you’re looking to sell, I’d love to have a one-on-one consultation with you and put you in touch with our stagers. If you have any questions about staging or other real estate topics, feel free to call me at 215-680-4652. Have a great day.
