<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing why you cannot trust Zillow’s Zestimates to be completely accurate valuations of your home.</em></p>

If you’ve visited the Zillow website, then you know about Zestimates. Are Zestimates an accurate representation of your home’s value? The simple answer is that typically, that number is imprecise. Zillow uses a specific algorithm, but a custom home valuation you can get from a Realtor or appraiser is much more precise.

**Factors that help determine your home’s value:&nbsp;**

* Condition of the home. Is it updated? Does it need repairs?&nbsp;
* Comparables. What comparable homes have sold in the last 180 days that compare?
* Location. This can truly impact your property’s value

These are all factors that Zestimates cannot take into account. A Zestimate might be a number that helps you get started, but for an authentic valuation, you need a custom one done by a professional.&nbsp;
