Are you unhappy with the way your house looks or are looking for easy ways to renovate it? If so, we are here for you! We have been renovating houses for years, so we have the experience and knowledge to share with you.&nbsp;

**One great idea that we like to recommend is installing hardwood flooring.** In my video above, you can see pictures of the before and after, showing the difference that installing hardwood floors made in this living room. We also painted the walls white, which [we talked about in our previous video.](https://suburblivingblog.com/how-to-brighten-your-home-with-white-paint.html) Overall, those small changes made a huge impact on the room and made it a lot brighter.&nbsp;

**Our recommendation for you is to bring a piece of your old hardwood with you** if the room is touching another room that has hardwood. This will make it a lot easier to select your new hardwood. We were able to get the flooring on sale, and we recommend going to Floors USA. We know the owner and get you a great contact. Plus, we can also put you in contact with someone who will install the flooring for you.&nbsp;

If you need help with any of this, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. We have renovated over 100 properties and can help you as part of our lifetime value. Call or email us anytime, and we look forward to talking with you!&nbsp;
