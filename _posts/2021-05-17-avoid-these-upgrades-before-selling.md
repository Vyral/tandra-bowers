If you’re a seller and looking to increase your home’s value, there are plenty of things you can do that will add to it. However, there are four specific upgrades that you should avoid because they won’t bring a good return on your investment:

**1\. Remodeling the second or third stories of your home.** If you have a multi-level home, focus on improving the main floor level. If you focus on the upstairs, you won’t get the same return.

**2\. Adding crown molding or wainscoting.** Try focusing on and spending in high-value areas like the kitchen and main level.

**3\. Building an accent wall.** It looks great, but it won’t necessarily increase the value of your home.

**4\. Making costly upgrades.** Replacing your water heater, furnace, or A/C unit is not the best idea. If they’re broken, it’s understandable, but if they’re functioning properly, there’s no reason to replace them.

Focus your efforts on the kitchen, main level bathrooms, flooring, and landscaping. Those are all high-value upgrades, along with painting.

If you want further info about the right home upgrades to make before selling, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
