<p style="text-align: center;"><em>2020 is underway, and if you want to sell, here’s what you should do first.</em></p>

When is the best time to list your house and sell? Simply put, it’s right now\! However, before you even get a Realtor to come through your door, there are a couple of things you can start doing right now.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

**1\. Declutter.** You want your depersonalize your house to look more like those HGTV homes, or kind of like a cozy hotel: stylish, but able to accommodate anyone. Box up those unused items in the attic and crawl spaces, and make sure cherished items are set aside for safekeeping.

**2\. Freshen your curb appeal.** Start trimming those bushes and trees. Putting a fresh coat of paint on your front door goes a long way, too. It leaves an impression on buyers and stands out in photos.&nbsp;

Get your home ready and set up your appointments now; the spring market is right around the corner, and no, it doesn’t begin when the weather gets pleasant—it starts much sooner than that.&nbsp;
